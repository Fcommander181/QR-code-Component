### What I learned

I learn how to use minmax function in CSS Grid to make my component responsive 

This is the way i use it :


```css
.container {
    background-color: white;
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: minmax(auto,300px);
    text-align: center;
    border-radius: 15px;
    gap: 10px;
    margin: 10px;
}
```
